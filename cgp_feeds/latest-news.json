She has many medical issues and does not work. She is approaching 70 years of age.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My brother has a wife and two children and lives in another state. I am married with no children and live a few miles from my mother. We both have decent jobs and are what I would consider middle-class suburbanites.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with my mother has been strained for many years. There is not a lot of contact between my brother and our mother, or expectation of assistance emotionally or financially. It has been this way for many years. There are no hard feelings on this front. My relationship with my brother is strong.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have assisted my mom financially since I started working as a teenager. About 10 years ago, I got married and bought a house, had a very demanding job plus responsibility for my mother&amp;rsquo;s medical, financial and emotional well-being. When I had medical issues of my own, it was all too much to handle and I landed in therapy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/i-secretly-charge-an-hourly-rate-for-caring-for-my-mom-2015-02-06&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;I (secretly) charge an hourly rate for caring for my mom&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While I still care for and provide for my mother, I learned the co-dependent relationship I had with her was unhealthy and I have scaled back significantly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I pay for her to have high-speed internet service at her home. I activated the service to be able to work from her house during a stretch of major medical issues where she needed someone to be with her. She now has a home health aide (government provided) three days a week and I have not found myself in that situation in over a year, but I still consider the Wi-Fi insurance, so I keep it. I also include her on my family cellphone plan. I bring her household items and groceries on every visit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;shareable&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I no longer pay for any more of her debt.

She uses her money on things I would consider careless and frivolous, but it is her money and I no longer intervene or express my frustration. She finds herself in a bind on occasion, having things like her cable TV or her land line phone terminated.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;She frequently gets calls and letters from collection agencies. These were things she would bring to my attention in the past and I would pay past-due balances, late fees and reconnection fees &amp;mdash; regularly. I no longer offer to do that. Over the years she has gotten the message and she really doesn&amp;rsquo;t push them on me anymore. It has relieved a lot of stress from my relationship with her. However, now they are just ignored and pile up without any action.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, it is very important to me to focus on my well-being, which means not returning to our previous relationship which left me damaged financially and emotionally. At the same time I have a lot of stress and anxiety about where this will leave me if and when (a) she passes on, (b) a decision has to be made to change her living situation (in my home or a nursing home) or (c) something major happens, like a legal judgment against her.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is financially smart. Without him, I would have likely traveled down the same financial road as my mother. With him, I have had the guidance and support to pay off years of mounting debt, buy a house and start saving for retirement. The thought of taking a hit to everything we have worked so hard to build causes a lot of stress. My husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and\/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with him. I just struggle with doing right by everyone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I would be responsible for financially as her daughter when she is truly incapable. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s smarter to move her in with us or start to look into assisted living\/nursing homes, especially if covered by the government programs that have covered her all these years.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What could I be doing prepare or protect myself financially?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cindy in N.Y.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Cindy,&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rarely has a letter moved me as much as yours. You have created a wonderful life for yourself and done so without becoming hard of heart to those in your life or bitter about the past. You have maintained a strong relationship with your brother and a relationship with your mother that is based on love and service, while maintaining healthy emotional and financial boundaries. You have since learned that you can&amp;rsquo;t do everything, nor should you have to do everything.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad that you finally realized that you cannot live her life for her. You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future. That&amp;rsquo;s nothing to feel guilty about. Plenty of children would have walked away. You didn&amp;rsquo;t. This is something that your mother was either unable or unwilling to provide for you. In the face of remarkable odds, you provided it for yourself. And yet you are still thinking of others.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;shareable&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Moneyologist&lt;\/cite&gt;\n\n&lt;\/footer&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moving your mom in with you seems to run counter to your desire to maintain healthy boundaries,&amp;rdquo; says Anne Tumlinson, founder of Daughterhood, a Washington, DC-based organization that provides information and resources to people caring for aging parents. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not necessary in New York. Additionally, your mother is already obviously on Medicaid so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about whether your mother will qualify, which is usually a huge thing given people&amp;rsquo;s assets and incomes that usually need to be spent-down first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are not alone. An estimated 43.5 million adults in the U.S. have provided unpaid care to an adult or a child within the prior 12 months, according to the 2015 report &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/my-mother-lives-below-the-poverty-line-but-i-stopped-paying-her-debts-2016-07-09?siteid=rss&amp;amp;rss=1&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Caregiving in the U.S.&lt;\/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by the AARP Public Policy Institute, the advocacy group for Americans aged 50 years and older.

Don&amp;rsquo;t co-sign any loans and maintain a clear line between her finances and your own and keep an eye on your credit score, in the unlikely event that your mother would take out a loan in your name (especially if you shared the same first name). &amp;ldquo;Unless you are a co-signer on a debt, you are in no way liable for your mother&amp;rsquo;s debts,&amp;rdquo; says Blake Harris, an attorney at Mile High Estate Planning in Denver. &amp;ldquo;There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything you need to do aside from continuing to follow your husband&amp;rsquo;s wise financial advice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some 28 U.S. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. Those states don&amp;rsquo;t include New York. &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/rosenblattesq.com\/lawyer\/2013\/05\/25\/Estate-Planning\/Filial-Responsibility-Laws_bl6821.htm&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list&lt;\/a&gt; of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t practice them. One of those states is Pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother&amp;rsquo;s bill. In 2012, Pennsylvania court ruled that John Pittas must pay his mother&amp;rsquo;s $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to Greece. Otherwise, they are rarely enforced.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AARP and other organizations have &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/assets.aarp.org\/www.aarp.org_\/articles\/foundation\/aa66r2_care.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;helpful guides&lt;\/a&gt; for preparing to care for an elderly parent. This includes figuring out what your mother&amp;rsquo;s needs might be and forming a team (that includes your brother and husband).

He received the card before his birthday, opened it and cashed the check with no acknowledgment of receipt. I know this because the check cleared the bank two days before his birthday. I&amp;rsquo;m not so old fashioned or naive to expect a handwritten thank you but he can&amp;rsquo;t even send a text? Is it unreasonable to expect acknowledgment before running to the bank? Where have all the manners gone?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Baffled Uncle&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Baffled,&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peter, Paul and Mary (&lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZgXNVA9ngx8&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;almost&lt;\/a&gt;) asked the same question.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot to buy a card, sign it, find the correct address and put a stamp on the envelope. I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s my age, but sending someone anything by snail mail is an ordeal. I visit the nearest shop that sells stamps at least once a week to buy a stamp (as they often run out). It&amp;rsquo;s either that or stand in line at the post office, staring at the guy with six packages and questions about the weight and category for each one. I could sign up to &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.stamps.com\/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Stamps.com&lt;\/a&gt; and avoid all of that. When it comes to thanking a friend or relative for a check, however, you should always make that trip.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;article-image-wrap shareable&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;article-image MG&quot; src=&quot;http:\/\/localhost\/marketmasterclass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/ei.marketwatch.comMultimedia20160720PhotosMGMW-ES037_money__20160720130712_MG-097657eb543dc9aa120275b867c3c8f39da0054f.jpg&quot; \/&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Terrence Horan\/MarketWatch&lt;\/cite&gt; \n\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most Americans believe good manners in the U.S. are on the decline over the last several decades, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/bit.ly\/29TSLDe&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;recent survey&lt;\/a&gt; of 1,000 adults by the Associated Press and NORC, a research organization affiliated with the University of Chicago. Some 74% of respondents bemoaned the prevalence of the usual suspects like cell phone use, increasingly course political discourse, tasteless jokes and bad language, but they also found a difference between younger and older generations. Almost half of Americans aged 18 to 29 feel it is acceptable to use cell phones in restaurants, for instance, while only 22% of those over age 60 agree. This is no excuse but, chances are, your nephew has never had to post a letter in his life.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;shareable&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a phrase in Ireland: &amp;ldquo;He didn&amp;rsquo;t lick it off the stones.&amp;rdquo; It means that people&amp;rsquo;s bad behavior is either inherited or taught to them by their elders.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Moneyologist&lt;\/cite&gt;\n\n&lt;\/footer&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, sales of traditional greeting cards have fallen by nearly 30% in dollar terms over the last decade when adjusted for inflation &amp;mdash; to $6.1 billion in 2014 and are expected to fall to $4.3 billion in 2018, according to industry research firm IbisWorld. Why send a card when you can send a funny GIF on Facebook? Even Hallmark has a $1 per month e-card subscription service. A wedding anniversary, Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, Bar Mitzvah, partner&amp;rsquo;s birthday &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/why-facebook-wont-kill-the-greeting-card-2013-04-15&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;all require a card&lt;\/a&gt;. (If a friend announces that his grandparent died on Facebook, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to press the &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; button.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t miss: &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/my-best-man-didnt-even-give-me-a-gift-after-our-wedding-2016-07-06&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Should I tell the best man he should have given me a wedding gift?&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And so to your nephew&amp;rsquo;s lack of appreciation. He&amp;rsquo;s 21 years old. Sure, he&amp;rsquo;s no longer a child. But I am going to give your nephew and his parents 50% share of the blame. Or give them both 100% of the blame. Either way, they&amp;rsquo;re both on the hook here. We have a phrase in Ireland (Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m going there again): &amp;ldquo;He didn&amp;rsquo;t lick it off the stones.&amp;rdquo; It means that people&amp;rsquo;s bad behavior is either inherited or taught to them by their elders. Your nephew proves himself very capable of cashing a check, but not licking a stamp. Regardless, he too should know better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? Even if you are not his godfather, I suggest stepping into that role. If you&amp;rsquo;re close enough to give him a check, you&amp;rsquo;re close enough to call up his parents or email them and say, &amp;ldquo;Did Kevin get my card? I want to make sure as there was a check in it.&amp;rdquo; Or speak to him directly and say the same thing. Does it tarnish the goodwill of the birthday card and check? It does a bit. But there is an opportunity here to give your nephew (and his parents) a more valuable lesson: The family&amp;rsquo;s reputation is on the line here, as well as next year&amp;rsquo;s check.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

The price-to-earnings-growth ratio, or &amp;ldquo;PEG,&amp;rdquo; should be at or close to 1.0.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a stock at 30 times earnings might seem overpriced if the average company in the industry commands a price-to-earnings ratio, or &amp;ldquo;P\/E,&amp;rdquo; of 20. But if analysts expect 30% earnings growth for the company over the next year, a PEG ratio of 1.0 is eye-catching.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the biggest metric we look at,&amp;rdquo; said Alec Young, a global equity strategist at Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;ldquo;A company may have a high P\/E, but, until you know what the earnings growth is, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ascertain whether the stock is attractive or not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, study the corporate balance sheet, a financial summary that &amp;mdash; along with the cash-flow and income statements &amp;mdash; reflects the quality of earnings. These documents tell you whether management makes, spends and invests shareholders&amp;rsquo; money wisely. Company websites should post 10-Q quarterly reports and 10-K annual reports, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission website&lt;\/a&gt; offers these and other informative disclosures.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;h6&gt;What to WATCH OUT for&lt;\/h6&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overpriced goods:&lt;\/strong&gt; Cost matters. Purchase price, more than the selling price, determines return on investment. Be cautious about highfliers that may be closer to the end of their runs than the beginning. That sports drink you can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of, for instance; the market probably knows it&amp;rsquo;s a top seller and has bid up the stock accordingly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could invest in the best company, but if you&amp;rsquo;re overpaying for it, you could end up losing money because the stock price already reflects the reason you&amp;rsquo;re buying the stock.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunches and headlines:&lt;\/strong&gt; Good companies aren&amp;rsquo;t always good stocks, and basing decisions on hunches and headlines is not an investment strategy. Don&amp;rsquo;t make investment decisions solely on one or two sentences of hype. Relying on unsubstantiated claims, rumors and online tips &amp;mdash; or your next-door neighbor &amp;mdash; is a mistake.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leave impulse buying for the supermarket and out of the stock market. Have patience. Time gives individuals a rare edge over short-term-minded institutions and hedge funds, which tend to trade frequently. Longer investment horizons smooth the ride down Wall Street and make market losses less likely.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Pump and dump&amp;rsquo; scams:&lt;\/strong&gt; As the old saying goes: Look around the poker table; if you can&amp;rsquo;t see the patsy &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;re it. With stocks, the players at the table are internet chat rooms and bulletin boards, spam email, investment newsletters, and even television and radio.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the delivery method, the classic &amp;ldquo;pump-and-dump&amp;rdquo; contains the same message: Buy this stock now, before everyone learns about the firm&amp;rsquo;s newest widget. The stock usually is thinly traded on the less-policed over-the-counter market, also called the Pink Sheets.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you and others like you buy into such a pitch, your demand will only boost the stock price, turning a tidy profit for those who bought in earlier than you &amp;mdash; often the very folks pumping the stock &amp;mdash; who then sell, tanking the shares and leaving newcomers with big losses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t take the bait. It&amp;rsquo;s tough to be skeptical when you&amp;rsquo;re told what you want to hear, but doing otherwise puts you at risk of being separated from your money by fraudulent promoters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love-struck stocks:&lt;\/strong&gt; Falling in love with a stock can bring reward, satisfaction and visions of a long-term relationship. Trouble is, a stock won&amp;rsquo;t love you back. If shares head south, you have to be ready to break it off and sell.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stay disciplined and diversified. Have a philosophy that you stick to that can be easily replicated and consistently applied. Don&amp;rsquo;t waver.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s not just about one stock. Many successful investors recommend having about 20 to 25 stocks in a personal portfolio. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how well you think you know a company. Anything can happen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climbing on bandwagons:&lt;\/strong&gt; Many people buy stocks but aren&amp;rsquo;t stock investors.

Yet bonds leave many investors scratching their heads: How much of an investment plan should be allocated to fixed income? Are bonds only for those nearing or in retirement? How can performance be tracked? Does lower risk necessarily mean risk free?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch FOR:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given bonds&amp;rsquo; relatively high trading costs &amp;mdash; and with pension funds, investment banks and corporations dominating the market &amp;mdash; most retail investors opt for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over direct bond purchases.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;inset video-inset&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;h6&gt;How to buy bonds&lt;\/h6&gt;\n(2:06)&lt;p&gt;Interested in buying bonds? They can be an essential component of a balanced investment plan, but there are big differences between bonds and stocks. Here are some good strategies to keep in mind, including managing costs and laddering bonds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some advisers say that&amp;rsquo;s just where smaller investors should stay. Others suggest individuals should invest directly only in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds and their inflation-linked equivalents, known as TIPS, that are sold via the government&amp;rsquo;s TreasuryDirect program.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds, high-yielding and higher-risk junk bonds, and municipal bonds and foreign government debt are best purchased through funds, they say.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve sets short-term interest rates, but its moves do tend to affect the bond market overall. The value of a bond moves inversely to interest rates on the premise that future bond issuance will bring higher yields, cutting the appeal of the old bond; falling rates raise the profile of higher yielding bonds already in circulation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;TreasuryDirect&lt;\/a&gt;, most major discount brokerages and financial firms that cater to individuals also handle bond investments.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Bond Market Association &amp;mdash; although it is the lobbying group for the industry &amp;mdash; offers a neutral informational website at &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.investinginbonds.com\/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;investinginbonds.com&lt;\/a&gt;. There, investors can find bond investing how-to, analysis, financial news and investment calculators.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, depending on the size of their investment portfolio and their tax bracket, investors may want to use a &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/calculators\/retirement\/tax-equivalent-yield-calculator-tool.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;tax-yield equivalent calculator&lt;\/a&gt; to see if municipal bonds are more advantageous than equivalent taxable bonds. Investors must also consider insured bonds versus uninsured; they offer a lower yield in exchange for protecting an investor against default.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With bond funds, investment researcher &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/bonds.html&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Morningstar&lt;\/a&gt; suggests this formula to determine how much a fund stands to gain or lose based on what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;duration&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; a measure of a bond&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to interest-rate moves: For every percentage-point shift in interest rates, the fund&amp;rsquo;s value will change according to its duration.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if interest rates go up by 1% and the duration of the fund is five years, the fund would lose 5%. If interest rates fall 1%, the fund would gain 5%.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, see &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/bonds&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;MarketWatch&amp;rsquo;s bond section for a roundup of news, analyses and tools&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to WATCH OUT FOR:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elusive pricing:&lt;\/strong&gt; The challenge of bond investing is aggravated by the fact that unlike stocks, there&amp;rsquo;s really no easy way to check daily prices of individual bonds. Still, pricing has become clearer. FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, has &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.finra.org\/industry\/trace\/corporate-bond-data&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;information on price and volume&lt;\/a&gt;, and links to resources. Check out the great resources at &lt;a href=&quot;\/\/www.investinginbonds.com\/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Investinginbonds.com&lt;\/a&gt;, from SIFMA, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. And government-debt auction data is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/www.treasury.gov\/Pages\/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Treasury Department website&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But because many bonds aren&amp;rsquo;t actively traded, it can still be difficult to find a specific issue&amp;rsquo;s market value at a given moment. Treasury market trading does reflect the investing climate surrounding bonds, but how an individual bond performs hinges on many other factors: price paid, time until maturity, economic and interest-rate outlook, and whether an issuer can redeem, or &amp;ldquo;call,&amp;rdquo; its debt ahead of schedule.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inflation also plays a role; it eats away the value of your bond income.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No free lunch:&lt;\/strong&gt; Bonds may have a lower-risk reputation compared with other investments, but they&amp;rsquo;re not risk free. There are three specific risks to be considered.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;articleList&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Default risk: The chance that an issuer won&amp;rsquo;t pay interest or the principal upon maturity; the higher the risk, the more an investor demands in yield compensation. Credit ratings on bonds assign a value to default risk.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interest-rate risk: The possibility a better rate will make your bond less attractive.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reinvestment risk: Whether you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to roll bond returns into an investment with a similar or better yield; this usually comes to bear in a deflationary environment.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees take a bite:&lt;\/strong&gt; Expenses cut bond returns even more than with stocks. Bonds are usually low-risk, low-return endeavors. Some advisers suggest buying funds with expense ratios no higher than 0.30%. If costs are higher, make sure the fund&amp;rsquo;s performance more than makes up for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversification is key:&lt;\/strong&gt; Diversification applies to types of bonds and maturities. One popular strategy to cut duration risk is to &amp;ldquo;ladder&amp;rdquo; a bond portfolio.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a laddered portfolio, investors spread risk across a range of maturities from say, two years to 30 years. The diversity also extends to the holdings.

Retirees are likely to have half or more of their investments in bonds; 40- to 50-year-olds are likely to have 20% to 60%; and 30-year-olds might have little or no bonds, by most guidelines.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from MarketWatch&lt;\/strong&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;","post_excerpt":"","post_terms":"[{\"term_id\":36,\"name\":\"News Retail\",\"slug\":\"news-retail\",\"term_group\":0,\"term_taxonomy_id\":36,\"taxonomy\":\"post_tag\",\"description\":\"\",\"parent\":0,\"count\":63,\"filter\":\"raw\"}]","guid":"http:\/\/localhost\/marketmasterclass\/marketwatch-and-learn-how-to-buy-bonds\/","featured_image":"http:\/\/localhost\/marketmasterclass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/s.marketwatch.compublicresourcesMWimagesMW-ER507_MWL_bo_ZG_20160714120324-4145852764c42aeb3c70d2277b833a3541c9018d.jpg"},{"ID":"285526","post_title":"Buffett, Dimon Write \"Common Sense\" Manifesto","post_date":"2016-07-24 19:31:00","post_content":"A number of business leaders signed a strangely-worded letter last week arguing for &quot;common sense&quot; corporate governance.","post_excerpt":"","post_terms":"[]","guid":"http:\/\/localhost\/marketmasterclass\/buffett-dimon-write-common-sense-manifesto\/","featured_image":"http:\/\/localhost\/marketmasterclass\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/i.investopedia.comcontentdaily_blogbuffett_dimon_writethinkstockphotos146297360-ddd72db25318ffa16bb517950af70cc7faa06a50.jpg"},{"ID":"285529","post_title":"Why Average Investors Can't Make Money (XOP)","post_date":"2016-07-24 19:00:00","post_content":"Average Investors are dramatically underperforming the market.
